1.Single Responsibility Principle -->

    -  Each component should only follow one task
    - Don't do multiple things in a single component
    - If you  have to do multiple things in a component then break it down to separate components

    advantages of separate
        - converting codes into moducles
        - More readable, testable code will be generated
        - Re-usablity of components
        - component will be maintainable


Custom Hooks --> If a component have more than one thing to do then we use custom hooks to
                abstract that task and we do it in custom Hooks

            1.In resutarantMenu component we fetch data and we display it 
            2. this component do 2 tasks 
            3.we can use custom hook to abstract the fetch data logic
            4.Now the component only have to do display the data
            5.By doing this if a bug arries we can easily find and solve

                - If the bug in fetching data go and fix it in cutom hooks
                - if the bug in displaying the data go and fix it in resutarantMenu component
            
            6. Always use one file for one custom hook
            7.custom hook name should start in use and file also
            8.Always put all custom hooks inside util folder


    3.Optimizing react app for prodcution ready

        - Break the app into smaller pieces
        - Make a smaller bundles of the big bundler js file is called chunking or code splitting or lazy loading or Dynamic bundling or onDemand Loading

4.Whys to optimize React projects

    1.single Responsibility Principle ---> using custom Hooks

        - If a single component have more than one task to do

            -eg: if a component to fetch api data from api call and display the data in the same file then
                 use the custom hook to fetch data and the component will only show the data

    
    2.Code splitting, lazy loading -- using lazy and suspense

        - if your app have a bigger components means nested component structure like amazon, makeMyTrip etc

        - split the components into smaller chunks

            eg: for restaurants 1 chunk
                for grocery 1 chunk
