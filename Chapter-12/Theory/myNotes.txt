redux performance

1.always specify exact slice and portion while using useSelector() for reading the data
2. reducers vs reducer
    a.reducers --> in slice multiple reducers for performing different tasks
    b.reducer --> in store only one reducer for the store which contains multiple
                  small reducers like cart, auth etc

3.old Redux ==> dont allow us to mutate the state
  new Redux ==> will say please mutate the state
                behind the scene redux is mutating the state by itself by the help of immerjs library
