                            the component and returns it back with additional Logics


2 Layers in React

    1.UI layer --> JSX
    2.Data layer --> state, props, {} inside jsx etc


3.Lifting state up ---> Taking state controls from child component and giving it to its parent
                        so that parent can controll the child component


4.uncontrolled component --> if a component have its own state and it controlls the state then its a uncontrolled component

5.controlled component --> if a component state is controlled by its parent component then its a controlled component

6.propsDrilling --> It's a process in which we pass props from a parent component to it's deep nested child component by passing the
                    the same props to the components in between them


7.contextApi ---> its kind of global place where data is kept and any child component can access it without props drilling
