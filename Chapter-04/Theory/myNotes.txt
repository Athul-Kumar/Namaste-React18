1.what is props?

    * properties that passed into component

    * Basically arguments that passed to functions

2.what is config driven UI?

    * controlling UI using config driven data that coming from Backend

3.why Need to use unique keys in map ?

    * if we have many components in same level inside a container
    * if we don't put unique keys then whenever new component added or removed
    * react will re-render all the component inside container 
    * it will lead to optimisation problems 


4.why not recommend to  use index as a key?

    1.Performance Issues due to unnecessary re-renders.

    2.Issues in data mapping in case list items are sorted, filtered, or deleted.

5.When is it safe to use index as key in a list?

    1.Data is static.
    2.When you know reordering of lists: Sorting, Filtering is not going to happen.
    3.In the absence of an id.

6.imp concepts!
* React Virtual DOM: 
    It's a lightweight representation of actual DOM, stored in memory and is never rendered.

* Reconciliation in React: 
    The process of syncing Virtual DOM with the real DOM.

* Diffing Algorithm: 
    The algorithm to find the minimum number of steps needed to update the real DOM.

* Assumptions for using the Diffing Algorithm:
    Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
    The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key attribute.
