1.What is Monolithic architecture ?

    - components of an application are tightly integrated into a single codebase
        and deployed as a single unit.

    - UI, Business Logic, data layers are combined in a single respos.

    - Have issues with scalability
    

2.what is Microservices architecture ?

    - components of an application are loosly coupled and integrated into different codebase also
        
    - Each component have its own specific ports for working

    - UI, BUsiness Logic, data layers have different respos

    - Have no issues with scalability


3.What is Separation of concerns ?

    - It's a design principle that encourages to divide a program into distinct and independent modules or components.


4.what is Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?

    - SRP is one of SOLID principles of OOPS Design!

    - SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility.

5.How microservices interact each other?
    - Microservices interact each other through well written API's
    - Each service is run own different ports

6.What are the two different approch to render the backend api data in UI?

    Two ways we can render data in UI

    1. Page Loads --> API fetch from BE ---> Render in UI

    2. Page Loads ---> Renders dummy UI ---> API fetch from BE ---> Re-Renders API data in UI

    In react and for Better UX it preferce to use 2nd approch!



7.Purpose of useEffect() Hook?

    - To render something after the rendering of a component

8.What is conditional rendering?

    - rendering something according to the basis of condition

9.what is rendering the component?

    calling the component is called rendering the component!

10.why and how we need to use state local variables in react rather than normal js local variables?

11. How the const state variable in useState can assign different value?

12.Is the whole component re-renders or the specific part inside the component re-renders?

13.Definition of react state variable?

    - whenever state variable updates react triggers the reconciliation cycle or it re-renders the components
