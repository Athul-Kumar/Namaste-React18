1.how useEffect works?

    a.what is the use of useEffect hook?

        -> To render something inside the component after the initial render of the component  
            we use useEffect hook for that!

    
    b.useEffect behaviour in different senarios?

        * useEffect without dependency array?

            -> useEffect will render every single time after  the component renders
        
        * useEffect with empty dependency array?

            -> useEffect only render one time after the Initial rendering of the component

        * useEffect with dependency array?

            -> useEffect will render everytime accoding to the change in dependecy array!


    2. UseState hook?

        1.use of useState hook?

            -> used to create local state variable inside functional component to sync the 
                data and ui layers in react

        2.Best practices of useState Hook?

            -> Never use useState hook outside of the functional component

            -> call the hooks on the top of the functional component

            -> never create usestate inside conditionals or loops will lead to inconsistency

3.React -router -dom ?

    1.createBrowserRouter --> for creating routes

    2.RouterProvider --> for providing routes to the render files

    3.useRouteError  ---> hook used for custom error messages

    4.outlet --->

    5.link --->

    6.useParams ---> dynamic routes


3.Single page application  --> In react everything is component.so whenever the page layout changes
                                it actually changing the component not reloading the whole page for changes.
                                via client side routing!


4.Two types of routing in web applications

    1.client side routing  --> when load the app for the first time all the code will be there.when another page should display
                                it will load that component.No network call needed for different pages

    2.server side routing  --> Make a network call and the page is coming from the server
