USEEFFECT HOOK

    how react useEffect Hook works internally?

    When is the useEffect is called?

        1.if no dependency array
            - After every component render!

        2.if an empty dependency array is present
            -  Only called on the initial rendering of the component (1 time call for useEffect)
            - doesn't call useEffect even if the component re-renders again

        3.If dependency array is present with local state variable

            - Every time the local state variable updates useEffect will called!


USESTATE HOOK

    useState is used to create local state variables inside the functional components

     whenever the local state variable updates the  whole component will also re-Renders

    1.Best practices with useState?

        - Never create useState outside the components
        -  Try to call the useState on the top of the functional component
        -  Never create useState inside conditionals, loops, functions other than component functions which creates inconsistency
        -
